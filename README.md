# Distance.ModConfigurationManager
This mod will allow you to change the settings of other mods from within the Distance menu. It aims to translate the old Centrifuge modding menu to BepInEx.

With this you won't need to close and re-open the game to change most settings of a mod!

<h3>KNOWN ISSUES:</h3>
- Hotkey configurations do not display in-game. <br>
- Mods with setting names that are too big will display awkwardly in the menu. <br>
